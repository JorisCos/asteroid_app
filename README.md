# Asteroid demo 

## About Asteroid

Asteroid is a PyTorch-based audio source separation 
toolkit that enables fast experimentation on common datasets and on a wide range of deep neural network architectures. 

More information about the toolkit can be found on our [ github repository](https://github.com/Asteroid-team/Asteroid).

You can also read our paper (published in INTERSPEECH 2020) available [here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04132)

We are looking forward to transferring our technologies
by enhancing what has already been released in Asteroid with new features. 
Including real time processing and multichannel processing and also adapting these methods to your use cases.
